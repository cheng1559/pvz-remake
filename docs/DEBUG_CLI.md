# Debug CLI

In Debug builds, press `/` or double-tap the bottom-right 100 CSS pixel corner in mobile mode. The CLI is unavailable during startup.

The previous controls are preserved: Tab cycles completions, Up/Down recalls the last 64 commands, Enter executes, and Escape/Cancel closes. The slash is optional. Names ignore case, spaces, underscores and hyphens. Grid positions are one-based. Explicit positions can use any board row; an omitted zombie row still follows the level's spawn-row selection.

Opening the CLI pauses gameplay and presentation time. Closing restores the previous pause state while preserving any new `/gamespeed` setting. Input and commands work at zero speed. Syntax errors flash red and keep the dialog open; condition failures close it and show the reason.

See the [command table](DEBUG_CLI.zh-CN.md) for all command signatures. Common examples:

```text
/gamespeed 2
/sun set 999
/plant repeater 3 1
/zombie normal 3 9
/item award
/win
/home
```

The current package provides Adventure 1-1, Peashooter, Repeater, normal zombies, sun and the level award. Completions use installed backend content. Flag waves, widescreen backgrounds and unmigrated content report that they are unavailable.

The dialog reuses `UI.dialog` and `UI.input`. Gameplay commands use the existing `debugCommand` channel and receive a `debugResult`; the backend validates and mutates the authoritative world. Audio/fullscreen settings use the menu API. Cooldown, sun-cost and collection preferences are reapplied to new sessions.
